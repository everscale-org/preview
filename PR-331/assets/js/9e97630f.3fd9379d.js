That is, you pay for the record once, but it will be stored forever. And here comes the interesting economics - blockchains are forced to limit the rate of recording transactions artificially so that the size of the blockchain state does not grow faster than data storage becomes cheaper. As a result, users are forced to compete with each other for the right to record data on the blockchain via an auction, and subsequently, transaction fees are increasing all the time."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Everscale, as a leading blockchain developer, never looks for easy and uncostly ways to solve blockchain issues.
